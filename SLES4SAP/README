# Introduction
This KIWI template is created based on SLES 15 JEOS for SLES4SAP 15 with comprehensive collection of softwares to support running SAP products.

The SAP product installer requires a fully functional desktop (X Forwarding is not enough), therefore the template automatically starts remote desektop service (xrdp) that allows viewer programs such as Remmina or Windows Remote Desktop Connection to login remotely with user credentials via session "sesman-Xvnc".

Please keep in mind:
- Register your system with SUSE Connect to get the latest product updates:
    SUSEConnect -e company@example.com -r YOUR_REGISTRATION_CODE
- Disable remote desktop service after having installed SAP products:
    systemctl stop xrdp; systemctl disable xrdp

# Building the image
Copy SLE-15 installer and packages ISO files to /tmp/SLE15-Installer.iso and /tmp/SLE15-Packages.iso, and then invoke kiwi (new generation) to build the image:

kiwi-ng --type vmx system build --target-dir fsroot --description ./path/to/dir/of/config.xml

The result image ("vmx" type, "qcow2" format) can be used on KVM-based hypervisors, such as qemu-kvm and OpenStack.
